Features
--------

### Vector Rendering
Rendering OpenStreetMap-data using MapCSS or a custom style interpreter. Using a vector format for mobile devices rendering offline map data on Android/iOS is also possible.

### Routing
Routing also using OpenStreetMap-data or most other available networks. Custom routing profiles are possible and offline routing on mobile devices can be done using a pre-processed binary format.

### Optimisation Code
OsmSharp started as a project for logistical optimisation. There are several solvers for the (A)TSP and some VRP's.
