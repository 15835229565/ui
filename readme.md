From the website:

OsmSharp used to do everything on top of what it does today, including routing and rendering geo data. This was too much and the name OsmSharp didnâ€™t make sense anymore. Now the old functionality has been replaced by several seperate projects:

- [OsmSharp](https://github.com/OsmSharp/core): Working with OSM-data, filtering, transforming.
- [Itinero](http://www.itinero.tech/): The routing project is now maintained under the name **Itinero**.
- UI: This UI and rendering project has not been replaced. Instead we recommend using [Mapsui](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui).
