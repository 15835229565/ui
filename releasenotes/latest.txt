- Added a read-only list of markers on MapViews on iOS/Android. Issue #78.
- Added a tag property on layers. Also issue #78.
- Added a RemoveAll(Predicate<Tag> predicate) method to all TagCollections.

Bugfixes:

- Fixed #67.
- Allow registration of a TraceListener even when listener is disabled. Fixes #69.
- Fixed culture-dependant ToString after move to PCL.

API Changes:

- Added RemoveAll() on TagsCollectionBase.
- Added DistanceToEnd on RouteTracker.
- Changed default abstract MoveNext() to MoveNext(bool ignoreNodes, bool ignoreWays, bool ignoreRelations) in OsmStreamSource. Breaking for custom implementations of OsmStreamSource.

- Added Tag property on Layer.
- Added Markers property on MapView (iOS and Android).
- Changed ViewChanged(Map map, float zoomFactor, GeoCoordinate center, View2D view) in Layer to ViewChanged(Map map, float zoomFactor, GeoCoordinate center, View2D view, View2D extraView). Breaking for custom layer implementations.
